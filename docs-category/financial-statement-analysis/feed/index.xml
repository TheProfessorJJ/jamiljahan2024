					<description><![CDATA[Learn about the key terminology that underpins the interpretation of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial statement analysis is a critical skill for investors, analysts, and stakeholders seeking to understand the financial health and performance of a company. To effectively analyze financial statements, one must be familiar with key terminology that underpins the interpretation of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Below are some frequent terms and definitions to know:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Accruals</h4>



<p>Accruals refer to revenues and expenses that have been recognized on the income statement before cash is exchanged. This concept is fundamental to accrual accounting, which matches revenues to the expenses incurred in generating them, rather than when payment is received or made.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Estimates</h4>



<p>Estimates involve the use of judgments and assumptions to determine values that are not directly observable. Examples include estimating the useful life of an asset for depreciation purposes or estimating the provision for bad debts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Judgment</h4>



<p>Judgment refers to the exercise of discretion or discernment in making decisions, particularly in the context of financial reporting. It involves the application of professional skepticism and consideration of relevant facts and circumstances.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Management Policy Decisions</h4>



<p>Management policy decisions encompass the strategic choices made by a company&#8217;s management that impact financial reporting and operational outcomes. These decisions can include revenue recognition policies, inventory valuation methods, and capital expenditure policies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Consistency</h4>



<p>Consistency in financial reporting refers to the application of accounting policies and methods consistently from one period to another. This allows for comparability of financial statements over time and enhances the reliability of financial analysis.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Carrying Value</h4>



<p>Carrying value, also known as book value, refers to the value at which an asset or liability is recognized on the balance sheet. It is usually the original cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization, impairment losses, or depletion.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Fair Value</h4>



<p>Fair value is the estimated price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Fair value measurements are used when assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on the balance sheet.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Realizable (Settlement) Value</h4>



<p>Realizable value, also known as settlement value, is the amount that would be received from selling an asset or settling a liability in an orderly transaction. It is crucial in assessing the liquidity and solvency of a company.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Accrual Accounting</h4>



<p>Accrual accounting is an accounting method that recognizes revenues and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of when cash transactions occur. It aims to provide a more accurate representation of a company&#8217;s financial position and performance.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">10. Going Concern</h4>



<p>Going concern assumption assumes that a company will continue to operate in the foreseeable future. This assumption is fundamental in preparing financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">11. Recognition of Elements</h4>



<p>Recognition of elements involves including an item in the balance sheet or income statement if it meets the definition of an element (asset, liability, equity, income, or expense) and satisfies specific recognition criteria related to relevance and faithful representation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12. Book Value</h4>



<p>Book value refers to the total amount of owner&#8217;s equity, also known as shareholders&#8217; equity, in a company. It represents the net assets of the company after deducting liabilities from assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">13. Minority Interests (Non-controlling Interests)</h4>



<p>Minority interests, or non-controlling interests, refer to the ownership stake in a subsidiary that is not owned by the parent company. These shareholders have a claim on the subsidiary&#8217;s profits and assets proportionate to their ownership percentage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Shares</h4>



<p>Shares (or stocks) typically refer to ownership units in a corporation. These shares can be categorized into different types based on the rights and privileges they confer to their holders. Here are the common types of shares:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Common Shares (Ordinary Shares)</h3>



<p>Common shares are the most basic form of ownership in a corporation. Holders of common shares have voting rights in corporate decisions, such as the election of directors and major business decisions. They also have the potential to receive dividends, although these are not guaranteed and can fluctuate based on the company&#8217;s profitability and management decisions. In the event of liquidation, common shareholders are entitled to a portion of the company&#8217;s assets after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders are paid.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Preferred Shares</h3>



<p>Preferred shares are a class of ownership that typically does not carry voting rights but has a priority claim on dividends and assets over common shares. Preferred shareholders receive fixed dividends, which are often specified as a percentage of the share&#8217;s par value or as a fixed dollar amount. These dividends must be paid before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders. In the event of liquidation, preferred shareholders have a priority claim on the company&#8217;s assets over common shareholders but are subordinate to creditors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Redeemable Shares</h3>



<p>Redeemable shares are shares that the issuer can buy back from shareholders at a predetermined price and time. These shares provide flexibility to the issuing company by allowing them to manage their capital structure effectively. The terms of redemption are typically outlined in the company&#8217;s articles of incorporation or shareholder agreements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Treasury Shares</h3>



<p>Treasury shares are shares that have been repurchased by the issuing company and are held in its treasury. These shares do not have voting rights or receive dividends while held by the company. Treasury shares can be reissued or retired depending on the company&#8217;s capital needs and strategic objectives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Dual-class Shares</h3>



<p>Dual-class shares refer to a structure where a company issues two classes of shares with different voting rights. Typically, one class (often Class A) has multiple votes per share, while the other class (often Class B) has fewer or no voting rights. This structure allows founders or insiders to maintain control over the company while raising capital through the sale of shares with limited voting rights to the public.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Founder&#8217;s Shares</h3>



<p>Founder&#8217;s shares are shares typically issued to the founders of a company at its inception. These shares may have special rights or privileges, such as enhanced voting rights or preferential dividend treatment, to ensure that the founders retain control and benefit from the company&#8217;s success over the long term.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS):</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Basic EPS is a measure of a company&#8217;s profit or loss attributable to each outstanding common share.</li>



<li><strong>Calculation:</strong> It is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.</li>



<li><strong>Formula:</strong> Basic EPS = (Net Income &#8211; Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If a company has a net income of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 common shares outstanding, the basic EPS would be $1.00 ($1,000,000 / 1,000,000 shares).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS):</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Diluted EPS adjusts the basic EPS calculation to include potential shares that could be issued through the exercise of stock options, warrants, convertible bonds, or other dilutive securities.</li>



<li><strong>Calculation:</strong> It uses the diluted number of shares, which assumes all potential dilutive securities are converted or exercised.</li>



<li><strong>Formula:</strong> Diluted EPS = (Net Income &#8211; Preferred Dividends) / Diluted Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If potential conversion of stock options and convertible bonds would add 100,000 shares to the previous example, the diluted EPS might be $0.91 ($1,000,000 / (1,000,000 + 100,000 shares)).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key Points:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> EPS figures provide insight into the profitability of each common share outstanding and are crucial metrics for investors assessing a company&#8217;s performance.</li>



<li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Companies are required to present both basic and diluted EPS on the face of their income statement to provide transparency regarding potential dilution from convertible securities.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Part 1: Financial Reporting</h2>



<p><strong>1. Objectives of Financial Statements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Financial statements serve to provide information about:
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial position</strong>: Assets, liabilities, and equity as of a specific date (Balance Sheet).</li>



<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Results of operations and net income for a period (Income Statement).</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>They also disclose information about changes in financial position and cash flows (Statement of Cash Flows).</li>



<li><strong>Objective</strong>: To aid users (investors, creditors, management, etc.) in making economic decisions.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>2. Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Information</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: Information influences decisions by users.</li>



<li><strong>Faithful Representation</strong>: Information is complete, neutral, and free from error.</li>



<li><strong>Comparability</strong>: Information can be compared with similar information from other entities.</li>



<li><strong>Understandability</strong>: Information is understandable to users with reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>3. Constraints on Financial Statements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cost vs. Benefit</strong>: The cost of providing information should not outweigh its benefits to users.</li>



<li><strong>Materiality</strong>: Information should be material enough to influence the decisions of users.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>4. Assumptions of Financial Statements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Going Concern</strong>: Assumes the entity will continue operations in the foreseeable future.</li>



<li><strong>Accrual Basis</strong>: Transactions are recorded when they occur, not when cash is exchanged.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>5. Measurement of Financial Statement Elements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Cost</strong>: Assets are recorded at the amount paid or fair value of consideration given at acquisition.</li>



<li><strong>Realizable Value</strong>: Assets are recorded at the amount that would be received in an orderly disposal.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>6. Qualitative Characteristics and Elements of Financial Statements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Performance Measurement</strong>: Primarily evaluated through the income statement, which shows revenues and expenses over a period.</li>



<li><strong>Financial Position</strong>: Assessed through the balance sheet, detailing assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific date.</li>



<li><strong>Shareholder’s Residual Claim</strong>: Reflects owners&#8217; equity, the residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities, presented on the balance sheet.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>7. Role of Financial Reporting</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Provide information about the financial position, performance, and changes in financial position of an entity.</li>



<li><strong>Users</strong>: Aid users in making economic decisions based on the financial information presented.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>8. Evaluation Tools in Financial Statements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Income Statement</strong>: Used to assess profitability and financial results from business activities over a period.</li>



<li><strong>Balance Sheet</strong>: Evaluates the financial position by showing assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific date.</li>



<li><strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong>: Analyzes the sources and uses of cash flows during a period.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Part 2: Income Statement</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Expenses on the Income Statement:</h3>



<p><strong>Classification:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Expenses on the income statement can be grouped by either nature or function.</li>



<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Classifies expenses based on what they are (e.g., salaries, rent, depreciation).</li>



<li><strong>Function:</strong> Classifies expenses based on their purpose or role in the operation (e.g., cost of goods sold, selling expenses, administrative expenses).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Expense Classification by Function:</h3>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong> Represents the direct costs incurred in producing goods sold by the company.</li>



<li><strong>Other Examples:</strong> Manufacturing costs, production overheads, and costs associated with sales and marketing.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Calculation of Gross Profit:</h3>



<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit = Revenue &#8211; Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</strong></li>



<li>Example Calculation:
<ul>
<li>Revenue: $4,000,000</li>



<li>COGS: $3,000,000</li>



<li>Gross Profit = $4,000,000 &#8211; $3,000,000 = $1,000,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Common Size Income Statement:</h3>



<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A common size income statement presents each line item as a percentage of revenue.</li>



<li>Facilitates comparison across time periods (time-series analysis) and across companies (cross-sectional analysis).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Comprehensive Income Calculation:</h3>



<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> The profit earned during the period from primary business activities.</li>



<li><strong>Other Comprehensive Income (OCI):</strong> Includes items that affect shareholders&#8217; equity but are not part of net income.</li>



<li><strong>Example Calculation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Net Income: $15 million</li>



<li>OCI Components: Unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities ($5 million), Unrealized loss on derivatives accounted for as hedges (-$3 million), Foreign currency translation gain on consolidation ($2 million)</li>



<li>Comprehensive Income = Net Income + OCI</li>



<li>Comprehensive Income = $15 million + $4 million = $19 million</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Other Comprehensive Income (OCI):</h3>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment:</strong> Reflects gains or losses from translating financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.</li>



<li><strong>Unrealized Gain on Available-for-Sale Securities:</strong> Unrealized gains or losses on investments classified as available-for-sale.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Items Classified as Other Comprehensive Income:</h3>



<p><strong>Criteria:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Items that affect shareholders&#8217; equity but are not included in net income.</li>



<li>Examples: Foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS vs US GAAP) Topic U.S. GAAP IFRS Similarities Example Purpose of Framework The FASB framework is lower in the hierarchy and isn&#8217;t prioritized if no standard exists. Management must follow the IASB framework if no standard or interpretation is available. Both assist in developing and understanding standards. In the U.S., if a specific standard isn&#8217;t available, management might not refer to the FASB framework, while in Europe, management must use the IASB framework for guidance. Objectives of Financial Statements Provides different objectives for business and non-business entities. Gives one objective for all business entities. Both aim to provide relevant information to a wide range of users. Both frameworks aim to inform stakeholders like investors and creditors, despite having different objectives for business and non-business entities under U.S. GAAP. Underlying Assumptions Recognizes accrual and going concern but doesn&#8217;t emphasize them much. Emphasizes accrual and going concern bases. Both use accrual and going concern assumptions. An IFRS-compliant company&#8217;s financial statements assume ongoing operations indefinitely, similar to the concept under U.S. GAAP but with more emphasis. Qualitative Characteristics Uses understandability, relevance, reliability, and comparability with a hierarchy. Uses the same characteristics without a hierarchy. Both frameworks use the same qualitative characteristics. While IFRS treats all characteristics equally, U.S. GAAP prioritizes relevance and reliability over comparability and understandability. Approach Historically rules-based, moving towards an object-oriented approach. Principles-based approach. &#8211; IFRS relies on broad principles for financial reporting, whereas U.S. GAAP has detailed rules but is moving towards a more principle-based approach. Performance Elements Elements include revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and comprehensive income. Elements are revenues and expenses. &#8211; Under IFRS, performance is measured by revenues and expenses, while U.S. GAAP also includes gains, losses, and comprehensive income. Financial Position Elements Assets are future economic benefits; &#8220;probable&#8221; is used in definitions. Assets are future economic resources expected to provide benefits; &#8220;probable&#8221; is part of the criteria. Both define assets and liabilities in terms of future benefits and obligations. Both frameworks define assets as future economic benefits, but IFRS explicitly uses &#8220;probable&#8221; in its criteria for recognizing assets and liabilities. Recognition of Elements Does not use &#8220;probable&#8221; for recognition; uses &#8220;relevance&#8221; as a criterion. Requires &#8220;probable&#8221; future economic benefits for recognition. &#8211; IFRS requires that an asset be recognized if it is probable that future benefits will flow to the entity, unlike U.S. GAAP which uses relevance without explicitly stating &#8220;probable&#8221;. Measurement of Elements Generally prohibits revaluation, except for certain categories discussed later. Revaluation is usually permitted. Both use historical cost, current cost, and other measurement attributes. IFRS allows revaluation of assets like property, whereas U.S. GAAP typically does not, except in certain circumstances discussed in later sections.]]></description>
